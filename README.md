# ESP8266_Checkbox_Control_WebServer_Interface

***********************************************************************************************
Abandoned I realised the animations were not playing for Fast LED since I need to get them into the main loop somehow. 
I ended up getting WLED (https://install.wled.me/) to work without disconnecting from my network so I went with that :)

*** This would be good to use for single colours etc, or as mentioned, simply adapted for on / off options for anything IOT

I created an ESP8266 hosted webpage that allows you to choose specific functions through a form and a range of checkboxes.

I am using this to run FastLED and choose different lighting options, but could be adapted to do anything .....
